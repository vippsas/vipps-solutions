# Loyalty at the Point of Sale

## How it works

_Vipps Loyalty at Point Of Sale (POS)_ is a solution that combines multiple Vipps products and makes a great product-market fit for retail stores that want to combine loyalty with payments. It's a great way to improve the payment experience for customers and simplify the process of adding customers to the merchant loyalty club.

The solution is a combination of the personal QR codes in the Vipps app,
the
[Vipps Login API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/login-api),
the
[Vipps ePayment API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/epayment-api),
and the
[Vipps Check-in API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/check-in-api).

The following describes the _Loyalty at the POS_ process at a high-level.

## Step 1: Scan the QR code

The flow begins with the customer presenting their QR code to the merchant. This can happen in two ways:

* Customer-facing scanner - The store will have a permanent customer-facing scanner and customers can scan their QR code at any time.
* Cashier scanner - The QR code is scanned by the cashier using a wired scanner. This could happen while the cashier is scanning wares or immediately before the payment.

The customer's personal Vipps QR code contains a URL like this:
`https://qr.vipps.no/28/2/01/031/4791234567?v=1`, where `4791234567` is their phone number in
[MSISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSISDN) format.

When the customer's Vipps QR code is scanned in the store, the POS will get their phone number.
This can be used for checking membership, in the next step.

## Step 2: Check membership

Check the customer's membership status by using the phone number you received in the previous step.

Use the
[Vipps Check-In API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/check-in-api)
and the
[`POST/v1/loyalty-check-in`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/check-in#tag/Loyalty-check-in)
endpoint to trigger a "waiting screen" in Vipps to inform the customer whether
or not they are a member of your loyalty program. This will help them through
the payment process.

If the customer is a not member, proceed to step 3 where you can enroll them by using Vipps Login.

If they are already a member, skip to step 4.

## Step 3: Request membership (optional)

If the customer is not a member of the loyalty program, you can request to enroll them by using
the [Vipps Login API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/login-api).

You already have their phone number from step 1, so just provide a button in your user interface to allow the cashier to initiate the login.

Pressing the button will trigger a
[Vipps Login flow](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/login-api/api-guide/flows/phone-number-ciba-flows)
to gather consent from the customer.
When this login flow is completed, the customer will be enrolled in the loyalty program.

## Step 4: Send a payment request

After membership status has been determined and all wares have been scanned, send a payment request to the customer.

You already have the phone number from step 1, so just provide a button in your user interface to allow the cashier to send the payment request. A notification will appear on the customer's Vipps app.

Once they authorize the payment, the POS will be updated with the status.
