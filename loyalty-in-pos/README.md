# Loyalty in stores

The general recipe is:

1. Merchant scan: The user presents the personal QR code and the shop
   employee scans it.
2. If the customer is a member, discount, etc,. is added.
   If the customer is not  member, he/she can join.
3. The payment is done with eCom API.
4. Recipe is added with Order management API.

The user is now a member, has paid and can see the receipt in Vipps.

The user can log in with Vipps on "my page".
