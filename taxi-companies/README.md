Scenario 3: The customer orders a taxi in the taxi company's app. After the journey, the taximeter initiates a push to Vipps. It is not necessary to enter the phone number manually, because it is already known.
The Vipps app opens on the customer's phone and the customer pays the amount due.

Scenario 4: The driver enters the customer's mobile number into the taximeter, which initiates a push.
The Vipps app opens on the customer's phone and the customer pays the amount due.
