The typical expiration time for payments is
payment is
[10 minutes](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/common-topics/timeouts).
But, in some cases, this is not enough time for a customer to complete the payment.

For instance:

* Paying at a doctor's office, where the payment request may arrive as the patient
  is leaving the office and doesn't notice it.
* Paying at a toll road where the driver cannot stop to complete the payment.

You can extend this expiration time for payments through the
[ePayment API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/epayment-api).

The customer can soft dismiss this payment by clicking `Cancel` -> `I'll pay later`.
This option will only be shown to payments that have `expiresAt` property set,
as shown below:

Soft-dismissed payments will be available in the Vipps app until expiry.
Vipps will remind the user when the payment is about to expire. For example:
