# In-store using Merchant Callback QR

ðŸ’¥ Please note: The Merchant Callback QR feature is being implemented, and is not yet available. Planned release is Q2 2023. ðŸ’¥

In this flow, a user pays by scanning a QR with their Vipps MobilePay app.
The merchant gets their ID and sends a payment request to them through the Vipps MobilePay app.

## Details

Before implementing this flow, please see the recommended [in-store payments flow](../in-store/README.md).

### Step 1: Generate a merchant callback QR code

Generate a callback QR code linking to your company landing page.
Print and place the QR code at your cash register or Point of Sale (POS).

<summary>Detailed example</summary>
<div>

The QR code contains a `Id` that connects it to a specific POS or cash register in your store.

Here is an example HTTP PUT:

[`PUT:/qr/v1/merchant-callback/{merchantQrId}`](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/api/qr/#operation/CreateMerchantRedirectQr)


```json
{
  "locationDescription": "pos_2345",
}
```

</div>
</details>

### Step 2: Create a webhook

Create a webhook that will send callbacks when this QR code is scanned by a Vipps user.

*The Merchant Callback QR feature is being implemented, and is not yet available.*

Here is an example HTTP POST:

[`POST:/webhooks/v1/webhooks`](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/api/webhooks/#tag/v1/paths/~1v1~1webhooks/post)

```json
{  
    "url": "<CALLBACK-URL>", 
    "events": [<future event is to be provided>] 
}
```

</div>
</details>

### Step 3: The customer scans the QR

When the customer scans the QR, your system will receive a notification that the customer is ready to pay with Vipps or MobilePay.
The notification will contain a token the merchant can use to start a payment.

### Step 4: Send the payment request

Use the token to send the customer a
[Create Payment request](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/api/epayment/#tag/CreatePayments/operation/createPayment).

Specify `"userFlow": "WEB_REDIRECT"` to redirect the user to the Vipps app.

You may attach the receipt at this time.

Specify `"customerInteraction": "CUSTOMER_PRESENT"`.

[`POST:/epayment/v1/payments`](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/api/epayment#tag/CreatePayments/operation/createPayment)

```json

        "id": "line_item_1",
        "totalAmount": 10000,
        "totalAmountExcludingTax": 8000,
        "totalTaxAmount": 2000,
        "taxPercentage": 25,
        "unitInfo": {

        },
      },
    ],
    "bottomLine": {
      "currency": "NOK",
      "posId": "pos_122"
    },
   "receiptNumber": "0527013501"

  "reference": 2486791679658155992,
  "userFlow": "WEB_REDIRECT",
  "returnUrl": "http://example.com/redirect?reference=2486791679658155992",
