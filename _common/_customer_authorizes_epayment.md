The payment request will appear in the customer's Vipps MobilePay app,
where they can select to pay or cancel.

To get confirmation that payment was approved, monitor
[webhooks](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/webhooks-api) and
[query the payment](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/api/epayment#tag/QueryPayments/operation/getPayment).

Once the payment is approved, update the status in your system.
