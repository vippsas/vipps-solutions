After final amount is confirmed, do a
[partial capture](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/epayment-api/operations/capture#partial-capture).
Then, release the remaining amount from the reservation with a
[partial cancel](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/epayment-api/operations/cancel#cancel-after-a-partial-capture).

Be sure to check the status of the captured payment.
