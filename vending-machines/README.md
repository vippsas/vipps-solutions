Vipps can make it easier for your customers to pay for products in vending machines.
The following are the most common scenarios.

## Scenario 1 - QR direct to payment in Vipps app

A [Vipps QR code](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/qr-api/vipps-qr-api#merchant-redirect-qr-codes) is posted on the vending machine.

When the customer scans the QR code, they go directly to the Vipps payment screen on their phone, where they can approve the payment.

## Scenario 2 - QR to a merchant site for payment options

A merchant-generated QR code is posted on the vending machine.

When the customer scans the QR code, they are taken to the merchant's landing page, which is waiting for the product to be selected on the vending machine.
The price is presented and the user pays for the product in their Vipps app.
