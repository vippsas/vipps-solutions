# Vending machines

Vipps MobilePay can make it easier for your customers to pay for products in vending machines.
The following are the most common scenarios:

* [Dynamic QR directing to the app for payment](one-time-payment.md) *(screen necessary)*
* [Static QR directing to the merchant site for payment](qr-to-merchant-site-payment-only.md)
* [Static QR directing to the merchant site for product selection](qr-to-merchant-site-product-selection.md)
